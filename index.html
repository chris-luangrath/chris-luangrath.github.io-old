  <p>I am a 2nd year student at Brigham Young University. I am currently working towards a degree in 
    computer science with an emphasis in animation. I currently work as a research assistant under David Wingate 
    in the Perception, Control, and Cognition Lab (PCCL). I am half Chinese and half Lao. 
    I speak English, Thai, and Lao.

  <p>This is a portfolio piece that I submitted with my application into the animation emphasis program. 
    The warehouse background texture, the metal texture on the blades and wings, and the floor texture are all not 
    mine, but images that I found online. This was for the last project in CSANM 150, where our prompt 
    was to design a bug. I decided to design a sort of praying mantis with with technological 'enhancements'.

  <p>This was another submission with my application. This was the for the first project in CSANM 150, 
    where our prompt was to make a lego person and put them in a scenario. I made this little skirmish
    with these 3 people. I painted simple textures in Clip Studio Paint for the lego faces and clothes,
    and the ground and backdrop textures were found online.
