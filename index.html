                <p>I made this website when I was learning with Code to Success, a program designed to help students get a head start in their coding experience.
                I figured out how to use HTML, CSS, Javascript, GitHub, and many other things while I was with them. However, the site that I made was just filled with pictures of things that I liked
                and projects that I made to practice my skills. However, for the most part, I mostly used C# and C++ because I was learning those in high school and competing in SkillsUSA. Web design
                wasn't really a part of my day-to-day, and this site was more or less abandoned. That being said, I'm a college student now, and this website can help me express who I am and what my goals are.
                Plus, it's important for programmers to have a portfolio of things that they can do. Thus, I need to fix this website up. This will be a project that I need to work on, alongside homework and responsibilities,
                so stay tuned! Sorry it's a bit of an eyesore at the moment, but it will look much better in due time, trust me!</p>

                <li>07/05 - 12/21/16 - This time was when I added a bunch of pictures and projects. The pictures are unecessary so I'm choosing to omit the change log for now. You can probably see them on the LEGACY SITE</li>
                <li>07/05/16 - it's the site's birthday!</li>
